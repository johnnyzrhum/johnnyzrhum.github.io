**AI Animation Experiment** 
Utilized ChatGPT to generate initial image from real life picture of our family pets. Then constructed this prompt in Gemini to generate video:

```
Animate the uploaded image into a short video.

The Boston Terrier stands upright and performs a smooth, joyful hula dance.
Add a red hibiscus flower behind the left ear, a pink Hawaiian lei around the neck,
a green hula skirt swaying naturally, and flip flops on the hind feet.

The dog gently sways side to side in a traditional hula motion.

Scene: sandy beach, palm trees on both sides, gentle ocean waves in the background,
bright sunlight with soft clouds.

Camera is stationary, full body view.
Style inspired by Lilo and Stitch animation.
Smooth motion, happy and festive mood.
High quality, clean animation.
